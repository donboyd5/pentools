\title{#' Calculate Present Value of Future Salaries (PVFS)
#'
#' This function computes the present value of future salaries (PVFS) for a given set of probabilities, interest rates, and salary values over a time period.
#'
#' @param remaining_prob_vec Numeric vector. The remaining survival probabilities for each period.
#' @param interest_vec Numeric vector. The interest rates for each period.
#' @param sal_vec Numeric vector. The projected salaries for each period.
#'
#' @return Numeric vector. A vector of PVFS values, where each element represents the present value of future salaries starting from that period.
#'
#' @details
#' The present value of future salaries is calculated by:
#' - Adjusting projected salaries by the survival probability at each period.
#' - Discounting future salaries to their present value using the interest rates provided.

Present Value of a Growing Annuity}
\usage{
pv(rate, g = 0, nper, pmt, t = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{rate}{Numeric. The interest rate per period (e.g., 0.05 for 5\%).}

\item{g}{Numeric. The growth rate of payments per period (default is 0).}

\item{nper}{Integer. The total number of periods (e.g., 10 for 10 periods).}

\item{pmt}{Numeric. The payment amount per period.}

\item{t}{Integer. Timing of payments:
\itemize{
\item \code{t = 1}: Payments occur at the end of the period (default).
\item \code{t = 0}: Payments occur at the beginning of the period.
}}
}
\value{
Numeric. The present value of the growing annuity.
}
\description{
This function calculates the present value (PV) of a growing annuity, taking
into account the interest rate, growth rate, number of periods, payment
amount, and timing of payments.
